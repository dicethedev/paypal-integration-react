# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Do this in your application

 Navigate to https://developer.paypal.com/developer/ 
 if you don't have account with paypal, create one and get started with paypal developer website.

 navigate to Accounts on the left hand side dashboard panel. Then on the right hand side you will see create account >> click on it >> choose account type option >> Business (Merchant account) and then your country location. 

// ------------------------------- NOTE -----------------------------------------------

 You'll be able to sell your products if you have an business account with Paypal and you can buy products if you create a personal account on Paypal.

// ----------------------------- End of NOTE ------------------------------------------

Navigate back to >> My Apps & Credentials > On the Rest API option >> click create app > input your app name and click the neccessary sandbox account >> Create App >>

You're only working with the Client ID. So, copy the client ID and then start working in your React application. check the implementation on the code in this repository.

The client ID that you copy >> paste it inside index.html inside public folder.
(<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=PASTE_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&currency=CAD"></script>)

Take note --- currency can be any region where Paypal is used

Thank you!

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
